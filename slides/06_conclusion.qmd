# Take away messages

## R package structure

-   R package = folder structure with (many) conventions
-   With modern tools `usethis`, `roxygen2` it is easy to start a new package
-   Packaging a set of functions is an ideal way to share with collaborators and the public
-   Start small and simple and over time you can learn additional options

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(emoji)
```

## Engineering Workflow

-   Use a workable workflow:\
    Idea $\rightarrow$ Design docs $\rightarrow$ Programming $\rightarrow$ Quality check $\rightarrow$ Publication
    -   Don't waste time on maintenance
    -   Be faster with release on CRAN
    -   Fulfill quality requirements of yourself and stakeholders
-   Refactor your one-off scripts that you want to use in a package
-   Use assertions for all arguments $\rightarrow$ better user experience
-   Implement common generics like `print` and `plot`

## Ensuring Quality

-   Apply common clean code rules, e.g.,
    -   Use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) to test, test, and test
    -   Use [covr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr) to improve the test coverage
    -   Use [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org) to optimize the code styling
    -   Don't repeat yourself!
-   Your rewards are:
    -   **Maintainability**,
    -   **Extensibility**, and
    -   **Performance**!
  
## Publication

-   `pkgdown` can help you easily create a nice website for your package
-   Versions and licenses along with `NEWS` updates are important
-   GitHub helps with tagging of release versions
-   R-Hub helps with checking before CRAN submission

## Possible next steps

-   Bring the information back to your colleagues in your organization
-   Start building your first own package and share internally first
-   Later publish it open source on GitHub and submit it to CRAN
-   Learn about more tips and tricks how to extend R
