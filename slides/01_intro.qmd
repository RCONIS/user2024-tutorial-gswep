## What do we mean by GSWEP4R\*?

::: aside
\* Good Software Engineering Practice for R
:::

-   Applying concept of "Good XYZ Practice" to SWE with R
-   Improve **quality** and **longevity** of R code/packages  
-   Not a universal standard; we share our perspectives
-   Collection of best practices
-   Do not reinvent the wheel: learn from the community

## Why care about GSWEP4R?

-   R is one of the most successfull statistical programming languages
-   R is a powerful yet complex *ecosystem*
    -   Core component: R packages
    -   Mature analysts: users & contributors
    -   Deep understanding crucial, even to just assess quality
-   Analyses increasingly require complex scripts/programs
-   The concepts are applicable to other languages, too (Python, Julia, etc.)

## Start small - from script to package

1.  Encapsulate behavior (functions)
2.  Avoid global state/variables
3.  Adopt consistent coding style
4.  Document well
5.  Add test cases
6.  Refactor and optimize code
7.  Version your code
8.  Share as 'bundle'

## The R package ecosystem - huge success

```{r cran-pkg-network, echo=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("resources/pkg_graph.png")) { # primitive caching
  library(tidyverse)
  local({
    r <- getOption("repos")
    r["CRAN"] <- "https://cloud.r-project.org"
    options(repos = r)
  })
  # get pkg cumulative downloads from last month
  db <- tools::CRAN_package_db()
  tbl_dl_ <- db %>%
      group_by(chunk = row_number() %/% 100) %>% # chunk to comply with API limit
      nest() %>%
      mutate(
          res = purrr::map2(
              data, chunk,
              function(data, id) {
                  cranlogs::cran_downloads(data$Package, when = "last-month") %>%
                      group_by(package) %>%
                      summarize(count = sum(count))
              }
          )
      ) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      select(res) %>%
      unnest(res) %>%
      distinct()
  tbl_dl <- filter(tbl_dl_, count >= 10000L, !is.na(count))
  tbl_deps <- tools::package_dependencies(
        tbl_dl$package,
        which = c("Imports", "Depends", "LinkingTo")
      ) %>%
      enframe(name = "from", value = "to") %>%
      unnest(to)
  grph_deps <- tidygraph::as_tbl_graph(tbl_deps) %>%
    left_join(
      tbl_dl_,
      by = c(name = "package")
    ) %>%
    filter(!is.na(count)) # remove base packages
  plt <- ggraph::ggraph(grph_deps, layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) +
      ggraph::geom_edge_link(alpha = .033) +
      ggraph::geom_node_label(
          aes(label = if_else(count > quantile(count, 0.975, na.rm = TRUE), name, NA_character_)),
          repel = TRUE
      ) +
      ggraph::theme_graph()
  ggsave("resources/pkg_graph.png", plot = plt, width = 8, height = 8/1.61, dpi = 300)
}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/pkg_graph.png")
```

## Pharma perspective: GxP + R `r fontawesome::fa("cube")` = `r fontawesome::fa("heart")`

-   Core infrastructure packages only through industry
-   Quality, burden sharing: open-source [pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/) and [openstatsware](https://openstatsware.org)
-   Open methodological packages can de-risk innovative methods
-   R packages make (statistical/methodological) code
    -   testable (with documented evidence thereof, [CFR Part 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_21_CFR_Part_11))
    -   reusable
    -   shareable
    -   easier to document
