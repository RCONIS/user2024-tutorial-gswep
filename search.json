    "text": "Description\nJoin us for an engaging 3-hour face-to-face course designed to enhance your R programming skills with a focus on developing reliable R packages used in statistics or data science. This course is a blend of informative presentations and interactive team exercises, aimed at equipping participants with practical tools and techniques for engineering high-quality R packages. Throughout the session, you will collaborate to build a small R package that adheres to clean code rules and incorporates good software engineering practices.\nThis course is tailored for individuals who are comfortable with writing functions in R and are looking to elevate their package development skills. Bring your laptop and be prepared to transform your approach to R package development through hands-on learning and collaboration. Whether you’re looking to improve your workflow, meet regulatory standards, or simply enhance the quality of your statistical tools, this course offers valuable insights and skills to achieve your goals."

    "text": "Learning Outcomes\nLearn, understand, and practice good software engineering rules. Participants will delve into the significance of good engineering habits to avoid the pitfalls of maintenance overload, inefficient development, and regulatory non-compliance. By emphasizing best practices, the course will guide them towards faster releases on CRAN, saving valuable time on refactoring for PoC to release version transitions, and fostering an open environment for community contributions on GitHub. All course materials, including R scripts, will be shared with participants via GitHub, providing easy access to resources for continued learning and application beyond the course."
