# Introduction

## A Word of Wisdom

![](screenshots/2024-03-17-22-24-36.png)

[@knuth1974structured, p. 268]

## Setting the right priorities

1. The code needs to be correct, i.e. calculate correct results as expected. → **Tests**, **Debugging**
1. If it is correct, but too slow, then find out which calculations and why they are too slow. → **Profiling**
1. Once you identified the slow parts, optimize those. 
→ **Code optimization**
1. If executing the code on your laptop is still too slow → consider running it instead on a high performance cluster (**HPC**), see slides from Lukas and Michael

## Tests: see previous [section](04_quality.qmd)

## Debugging: A few pointers

1. Post-hoc `traceback()` after code fails, to show the call stack and see how the error came about.
1. Setting `debug(myfun)` for the problematic function `myfun` and then run the code to step through its execution.
1. Inject `browser()` calls into problematic code to add "breakpoints" for interactive execution and inspection.
1. Setting `options(error = recover)` and then running the problematic code allows you to jump into the call stack and inspect. (Undo with `options(error = NULL)`)

## Debugging: Some RStudio specifics

Let's have a look at RStudio IDE specific details. 

- The "Debug" menu can be useful to explore the options.
- Editor breakpoints: Can add with click to the left of line number and gives "red dot".
- Click on "Source" to run the script and enter debug mode.
- "Debug" > "On Error" > "Break in Code" again lets you jump into the code on error.
- Debugging in Rmarkdown documents can be tricky, either proceed chunk by chunk, or try `sink()`

# Profiling

## Profiling: Definition

> In software engineering, profiling ("program profiling", "software profiling") is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization, and more specifically, performance engineering.

([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)))

## Profiling: Example code

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
f <- function() {
    profvis::pause(0.1)
    for (i in seq_len(3)) {
        g()
    }
}
g <- function() {
    profvis::pause(0.1)
}
```

## Profiling: Let's identify the bottlenecks!

In R there are a couple of basic functions for profiling:

- `system.time()`
- `Rprof`: 
  1. start with `Rprof()`
  1. execute the code
  1. stop with `Rprof(NULL)`
  1. summarize with `summaryRprof()`

See e.g. @peng2016, chapter 19, for details.

## Profiling: Classic `Rprof` output

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
Rprof()
f()
Rprof(NULL)
summaryRprof()
```

## Profiling: Getting visual

We can use the more modern [`profvis`](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis) R package for visualizing where R spends its time during code execution.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
library(profvis)
source("profexample.R") # Such that the flame graph includes code lines.
prof <- profvis({
    f()
})
print(prof)
```

# Code optimization

## Code optimization: Explore alternatives

- If the slow function is from another package, search for a faster one
- Runtime complexity (runtime as a function of data size) of different algorithms can be
wildly different - some work well on small data but take forever on large data
- Few examples:
  - For wrangling data frames, consider [`duckplyr`](https://duckdblabs.github.io/duckplyr/) and [`polars`](https://rpolars.github.io/) as alternatives to [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - To read and write CSV data, consider [`vroom`](https://vroom.r-lib.org/) instead of base R
  - To read and write objects from and to disk, consider [`qs`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qs) instead of base R `readRDS`, `saveRDS`

## Code optimization: DRY on data frames

- Remember: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Data frames are expensive, i.e. take a lot of time.
- Some examples:
  - Only create data frames, if really necessary. 
    - Bad: `if(nrow(filter(x, condition)) > 0)`
    - Good: `if(any(condition))`
  - Assemble a data frame only once, not iteratively.
  - When subsetting a data frame and working with a column, first extract the column and then subset.

## Code optimization: Reuse, don't copy

Avoid making unintended copies of objects.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE
# Bad:
result <- c()
for (i in 1:1000) result <- c(result, fun(i))
# Good:
result <- numeric(1000)
for (i in 1:1000) result[i] <- fun(i)
# Better:
result <- sapply(seq_len(1000), fun)
```

Other examples:

- Create a `data.frame` once from complete column vectors, rather than `rbind()` it iteratively.
- Subsetting a matrix or `data.frame` will create a copy, so use it consciously or better work with columns.

## Code optimization: Vectorize where possible

- Avoiding for loops does not help much anymore.
- However, using specialized vectorized functions (implemented in compiled code) helps:
  - Base R: `rowSums()`, `colSums()`, `rowMeans()`, `colMeans()`
  - [`matrixStats`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats): many! `anyMissing()`, `colQuantiles()`, `rowMax()`, etc.
  - [`collapse`](https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/): `fmean()`, `TRA()`, `GRP()`, ...

## Code optimization: Still too slow?

> "R is a language optimized for human performance, not computer performance"

(Hadley Wickham, New York R Conference, 2018)

## Code optimization: Shift to C++ with `Rcpp`

Writing and using C++ code in your R package is not easy.

But it is not too difficult with [`Rcpp`](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) by @Eddelbuettel2011.

- Starting point: `Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton()` 
- Use [`RcppArmadillo`](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html) for linear algebra
- Hadley Wickham's chapter [Rewriting R code in C++](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html)

Note: Adding C++ code to your package will in many cases increase the maintenance effort significantly.

# Exercise

- Read [`bootstrap.R`](examples/optimization/bootstrap.R) and understand what is going on.
- Run [`profbootstrap.R`](examples/optimization/profbootstrap.R) to see where most of the time is spent - where?
- In a second version of the function, `impl_2`, only update vectors inside the loop and then create a `tibble` once at the end.
- In a third version `impl_3` only subset the column instead of the whole `data.frame`. How much faster does it get?
- In a fourth version `impl_4` use the [`boot`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=boot) package.
- Homework: Try to come up with a fifth version `impl_5` that uses `Rcpp`. Was it worth the effort?
