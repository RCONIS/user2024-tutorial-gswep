# Overview

- Literate programming: Quarto
- Package environment: `renv`
- Exercise on how to use them together

# Literate Programming: Quarto

## What is Quarto?

-  Format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto))

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
-  An open-source scientific and technical publishing system ([Quarto.org](https://quarto.org/))
   -  Integrates text, code, and output
   -  Can create multiple different types of products (documents, slides, websites, books)

## Why not R Markdown?

Only because Quarto is newer and more featured!

- Almost everything you already know how to do in R Markdown you can do in Quarto, and more!
   - See a comparison [here](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html#i-use-x-bookdown-blogdown-etc..-what-is-the-quarto-equivalent)
- All of these slides, website, etc. are all made in Quarto.
- If you know and love R Markdown, you can keep using it
   - There are no plans for deprecation of R Markdown

## Quarto workflow

1.  Create a Quarto document
2.  Write code (in R, Python, Julia, or Observable JavaScript)
3.  Write text (with markdown syntax)
4.  Repeat 2-3 in whatever order you want
5.  Render

## How does the rendering work?

-   `knitr` processes the code chunks, executes the R code, and inserts the code outputs (e.g., plots, tables) back into the markdown document
-   `pandoc` transforms the markdown document into various output formats

![](https://github.com/louisahsmith/epi590r-2023/blob/main/day-2/slides/images/2b931008-dc7c-4bec-92cb-112a55126975.png?raw=true)

## Text and code...

````         
# My header

Some text

Some *italic text*

Some **bold text**

- Eggs
- Milk

```{{r}}
x <- 3
x
```
````

## ... becomes ...

### My header

Some text

Some *italic text*

Some **bold text**

-   Eggs
-   Milk

```{r}
x <- 3
x
```

## R chunks

Everything within the R chunks has to be valid R.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
x <- 3
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
x + 4
```

Chunks run in order, continuously, like a single script.

## YAML

At the top of your Quarto document, a header written in *yaml* describes options for the document:

``` yml
---
title: "My document"
author: Louisa Smith
format: html
---
```

There are a *ton* of possible options (more below), but importantly, this determines the document output.

## Output

![](https://github.com/louisahsmith/epi590r-2023/blob/main/day-2/slides/images/6f28e7d4-3394-43f9-8b0d-41c52de3883f.png?raw=true)

##  {background-iframe="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html" background-interactive="true"}

## Chunk options

For example, to suppress the code printing:

````
```{{r}}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```
````
`#| echo: false` tells `knitr` to exclude the source code from the output.

:::aside
In RMarkdown, you would have written this `{r, echo = FALSE}`. You can still do that with Quarto, but it's generally easier to read, particularly for long options (like caption titles)
:::

## Chunk options

Additional chunk options which are often used:

- `#| eval: false`: Don't evaluate this chunk! Just print the code.
- `#| error: true`: Render this *even if* the chunk causes an error.
- `#| warning: false`: Don't print warnings.
- `#| include: false`: Suppresses all output from the code block.
- `#| cache: true`: Use `knitr` caching mechanism for this chunk.

## Document options

You can tell the *entire* document not to evaluate or print code (so just include the text!) at the top:
```yml
---
title: "My document"
author: Louisa Smith
format: html
execute:
  eval: false
  echo: false
---
```

Careful! YAML is *really* picky about spacing.

## Document options

There are [lots of different options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) for the document.

- For example, you can choose a [theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html):
```yml
---
format:
  html:
    theme: yeti
---
```
- Remember the pickiness: when you have a format option, `html:` moves to a new line and the options are indented 2 spaces

## Chunks can produce figures and tables

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "This is a great table"
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:3,])
```

## Chunks can produce figures or tables

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a histogram"
hist(rnorm(100))
```

## Cross-referencing

You can then refer to those with `@tbl-one` and `@fig-hist` and the Table and Figure ordering will be correct (and linked)

::: larger-code
```         
@fig-hist contains a histogram and @tbl-one a table.
```
:::

gets printed as:

@fig-hist contains a histogram and @tbl-one a table.

## Inline R

Along with just regular text, you can also run R code *within* the text:

::: larger-code
```
There were `r knitr::inline_expr("3 + 4")` participants
```
:::
becomes:

There were `r 3 + 4` participants

## Inline stats

You might want to create list of stats that you want to report in your manuscript:

```{r}
#| eval: false
stats <- list(n = nrow(data),
              mean_age = mean(data$age))
```

I can then print these numbers in the text with:

```{r}
#| echo: false
stats <- list(n = 1123,
              mean_age = 43.5)
```

There were `` `r knitr::inline_expr("stats$n")` `` participants with a mean age of `` `r knitr::inline_expr("stats$mean_age")` ``.

which turns into:

There were `r stats$n` participants with a mean age of `r stats$mean_age`.

# Package Environment: `{renv}`

## What is `{renv}`?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

`{renv}` is an R package for managing project dependencies and creating reproducible package environments.

## Benefits of using `{renv}`

1.  **Isolation:** Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because `{renv}` gives each project its own, private, library of R packages.
2.  **Reproducibility:** `{renv}` records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.
3.  **Portability:** Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. `{renv}` makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.

## Getting Started with `{renv}`

1.  Install `{renv}` (only once):
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    install.packages("renv")
    ```

1.  Initialize a project (only once):
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    renv::init()
    ```

1.  Install packages:
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    install.packages("other_package")
    # Below only works because we use `renv` here:
    install.packages("github_user/github_package")
    ```

1.  Track dependencies via a "lockfile":
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    renv::snapshot()
    ```

## Behind the scenes

-   Your project `.Rprofile` is updated to include:
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    source("renv/activate.R")
    ```

-   This is run every time R starts, and does some management of the library paths to make sure when you call `install.packges("package")` or `library(package)` it uses the private library
-   An `renv.lock` file (really just a text file) is created to store the names and versions of the packages. This is the "lockfile" mentioned above.

## `renv.lock`

```json         
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "4.3.0",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cran.rstudio.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "R6": {
      "Package": "R6",
      "Version": "2.5.1",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R"
      ],
      "Hash": "470851b6d5d0ac559e9d01bb352b4021"
    },
    base64enc": {
      "Package": "base64enc",
      "Version": "0.1-3",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Requirements": [
        "R"
      ],
      "Hash": "543776ae6848fde2f48ff3816d0628bc"
    },
```

## Using `{renv}` later

- Restore an environment:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::restore()
  ```

- Install new packages:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  install.packages("other_package")
  ```

- Update the lockfile:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::snapshot()
  ```

## Collaboration with `{renv}`

-   Share the project's `renv.lock` file with collaborators to ensure consistent environments
    -  With `git`, you’ll need to commit `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, `renv/settings.json` and `renv/activate.R`. This is particularly simple because `{renv}` will create a `.gitignore` for you, and you can just commit all suggested files.
-   When they run `renv::restore()`, the correct versions of the packages will be installed on their computer
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    renv::restore()
    ```

## Other helpful functions

- Remove packages that are no longer used:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::clean()
  ```

- Check the status of the project library with respect to the lockfile:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::status()
  ```

  This will tell you to `renv::snapshot()` to add packages you've installed but haven't snapshotted, or `renv::restore()` if you're missing packages you need but which aren't installed.

- Update packages which are out-of-date (only checked from their original source):
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::update()
  ```

## Package Development with `{renv}`

- Install all of your package's dependencies as per `DESCRIPTION` file:
  ```{r}
  #| eval: false
  #| echo: true
  renv::install()
  ```

- If you need to test your package with other development versions, use `Remotes` field and a project specific library:
  ```yaml
  Remotes:
    r-lib/ggplot2
  ``` 
- In order to avoid `R CMD build` performance hit, by default, `{renv}` will create a package project specific library *outside* of the directory.
  - Exact location may be controlled with environment variable `RENV_PATHS_LIBRARY_ROOT`

## Package Development with `{renv}` (cont'd)

- Continuous integration (CI) is well supported
  - Basic idea is to `renv::restore()` the package environment on the CI machine, and use provided cache as best as possible
  - Example: GitHub Actions (details are given [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/ci.html#github-actions))
    ```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
    ```
- Ignore the `{renv}` lockfile and the package folder when building the tarball for CRAN submission
  - `{renv}` should automatically edit `.Rbuildignore` accordingly, just good to double check

## Conclusion

`{renv}` benefits are
**isolation**, **reproducibility**, and **portability**.

Getting started with `{renv}`:

1.  Initialize a project using `renv::init()`.
2.  Install packages and then save with `renv::snapshot()`.
3.  Restore later or elsewhere with `renv::restore()`.

# Exercise

## Exercise 1: Create a Quarto Project with `{renv}`

1. Create a new Quarto project via File > New Project > New Directory > Quarto Project in RStudio.
1. Enable the use of `{renv}`
1. Create Project
1. Write a short introduction and perform a simple analysis
1. Render the document

## Exercise 2: Use `{renv}` for dependencies

1. Add any additional R packages your analysis needs:
   ```{r}
   #| eval: false
   #| echo: true
   install.packages("RQuantLib") # Example non-standard package
   ```
1. Check `renv::status()` and the lockfile - did anything change?
1. Now use the additional R package in your Quarto document:
   ```{r}
   #| eval: false
   #| echo: true
   library("RQuantLib")
   ```
1. Check the status again and record the state with `renv::snapshot()`
1. Close the project and confirm that the package is not available anymore
1. Open the project and confirm that the package is available
